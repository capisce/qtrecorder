Plugin for recording Qt applications

To use it, launch apps with -plugin recorder

If recording is slow, try recording only every N frames, by using
-plugin recorder:N, for example -plugin recorder:2.

Only the first window that receives focus will be recorded, and only
QQuickViews are supported currently.

The images are stored in /tmp/appname-pid/
